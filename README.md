How to play Crazy Eights.

You and the computer are dealt 5 cards.
The first card in the deck is flipped over and used as a "starter" current card.
You take turns playing cards.
To play a card it must match either the suit or number of the current card.
Eights are considered wild cards and can be played whenever, and the person who plays the eight gets to change the suit to a new one if they want.
If you are unable to play any cards you may take a card off the top of the deck and either play that card or if you still cannot play any card 
then you must draw cards until you can play a card
The goal of the game is to get to 0 cards.
